 JamAuthToken        Chars                                       A unique string issued to the Retailer.
									Either token 
									must be present

 PlanID              BigInt (13)    No                           The Plan ID that represents the recently created order.
 
 NewPurchasePrice    Money          No                           Must be zero, or greater than zero and less than the current Purchase Price for
                                                                 the Plan ID concerned. Either NewPurchasePrice OR ReducePriceBy must be supplied. In the event that both are greater than zero, they both must be accurate (i.e. New Purchase Price and Reduction are correct).
 
 ReducePriceBy       Money          No                           Must be zero, or greater than zero and less than the current Purchase Price for

 FullRefund       True/False        No                            If True then the entire Plan will be Refunded instead of reduced. 
                                                                  A setting of True here will completely override the NewPurchasePrice and ReducePriceBy field values. If Null then assumed to be False.
